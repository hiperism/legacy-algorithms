! PURPOSE: compute the Legendre Polynomial zeros for a default
!          range of orders from 1 to 150
!          where the lower and upper bounds are selectable in the code
!          These zeros are bounded by an inequality using the zeros of
!          the spherical Bessel function of order zero as input data

!
! This code was developed on the Telefunken TR-440 with Fortran IV in 1973
! which provided a word length with some 24 decimals in double precision:
!     IMPLICIT REAL*8(A-H,O-Z)
! However, current commodity processors need to be forced to use quadruple
! precision using IMPLICIT REAL*16(A-H,O-Z) and constants defined as:
!     1.0Q+00, etc.
! In addition the compiler must be forced to avoid optimizations that
! would truncate precision. In the current example, the Intel compiler is
! invoked with:
!
! -mieee-fp -init=arrays,zero -double-size 128 -real-size 128 -integer-size 32
!
! to compile on a Linux Operating System:
!            make > make.log 2>&1
! to run on a Linux Operating System:
!            ./run
! verify output by comparison with:
!             fort.7.backup
!             j0-150.out.backup
