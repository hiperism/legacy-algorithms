!
!          PURPOSE: compute the Legendre Polynomial zeros for a default
!          range of orders from 1 to 150
!          where the lower and upper bounds are selectable in the code
!          These zeros are bounded by an inequality using the zeros of
!          the spherical Bessel function of order zero as input data
